Ques: What is the difference between dynamicall typed language(JS) vs. a statically typed language(Java)

Ans: In a statically written language such as Java, you have to specify exactly which types each variable will hold.
This helps prevent runtime error.
  ex. String a = 'moo';
      a = 1; // Error
     
     In a dynamically written language like JS, the type of variable is dynamically evaluated at runtime.
Therefore, you can change type along the way.
  ex. var a = 'moo';
    typeof(a); // String
      a = 1;
    typeof(a); // Number
Thus, writing is much quicker than Java but errors will occur at runtime.
